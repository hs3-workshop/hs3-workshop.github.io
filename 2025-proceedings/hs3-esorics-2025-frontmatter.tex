It is the task of the volume editor to prepare the Organization pages and the
Preface and to structure the volume in comprehensible parts. The Preface
should give a good introduction to the volume and present the conference or
workshop, mentioning the venue, dates, and the focus of the event. Clear
information regarding the peer review process (single or double
blind\,/\,number of reviews per paper) and the numbers and types (full,
short, invited) of papers submitted and accepted should be given. If invited
papers are included in the main part of the manuscript, please include a
sentence or two in the Preface explaining how they were reviewed. For
contributions co-authored by any committee members, please explain in the
Preface how these were objectively handled during the review phase.

The Preface is usually one or two pages long and is followed by the
Organization pages. By default, for Springer Computer Science proceedings
volumes, the volume editors (the people named on the book cover) should be
the Program Committee Chairs, and they should also be the people who write
the Preface. In this way, the Program Committee Chairs take responsibility
for the scientific program of the conference, and for decisions on the
content of the Springer-published proceedings.

If you plan any other approach, i.e., if you plan to have volume editors who
are not the Program Committee chairs, please contact the Springer Editor to
explain and to seek approval. If approved, we ask you to include a sentence
about this in the Preface.

The names and roles of all of the Chairs should be included on the
Organization pages. When listing the Program Committee members, kindly just
state their names, their universities/affiliations and their countries and do
not include the departments or the institutes within the universities. The
names of the committee members should be ordered alphabetically, according to
surname, as shown on the Organization pages following on from this Preface.
Please also make sure that affiliations are spelt consistently.

At the end of the Organization pages, the sponsors may be listed and their
respective logos displayed. The Steering Committee members are usually listed
above the Program Committee members.

We prefer the use of American English in the Preface and we ask you to write
the Preface in the past tense, because it is mainly read after the event. The
Preface and the Organization pages will be copy-edited at our end, and any
corrections are submitted to the corresponding volume editor for approval.
Light technical copy-editing of the papers may also be performed.

The final Table of Contents is created by Springer from the title information
in the papers. However, we ask you to provide us with a preliminary Table of
Contents when you send the files. This should contain the titles of the
papers and the names of the authors in the order in which they are to appear
in the volume and should include topical section headings. The papers should
be grouped according to the topics they address and not according to the
sessions of the conference. Any session numbering will be deleted by our
typesetters. Please include all papers pertaining to one topic under one
single topical heading, even if there are/were two or three such sessions at
the conference. If the titles given in your preliminary Table of Contents
differ from those in the papers, then we take the paper titles to be the
correct ones and create the final Contents accordingly.

The Author Index is also generated at Springer, but you can help us present
the authors’ names in the correct way by submitting a list of authors who
have complex family names, particles, or suffixes, or do not use the Western
name order (i.e., given name(s); family name). It should be made quite clear,
which part of the name is the given name and which is the family name.

Please check that the names of the authors are written consistently
throughout the proceedings volume. If an author has contributed to more than
one paper, their name should be spelt and structured in an identical manner
in all papers as well as in the Table of Contents.

At the end of the preface, the month and year should be inserted on the
left-hand side and the names of the authors of the preface (i.e., the PC
Chairs) should be listed on the right-hand side. Please note that pages I--IV
(in front of the Preface) are prepared by Springer.
