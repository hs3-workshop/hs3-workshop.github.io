# Abstract

The HS3 workshop seeks to share experience, tools and methodology on
hardware-assisted software security. We are looking forward to submissions
that propose new architectures offering better resilience against software
attacks. These architectures should rely on hardware-based security
mechanisms to protect the software stack. One of the challenges is to
formally specify and verify the security guarantees offered by such
architectures and to better assess the security guarantees provided by
existing hardware architectures against software attacks, especially
attacks against micro-architecture. This can be achieved by identifying new
vulnerabilities using reverse engineering, fuzzing or other attack
approaches. The goal of the HS3 workshop is to provide a forum for
researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government that
work on hardware-assisted software security. HS3 2025 has a special theme
on "Secure Monitoring, Intrusion Detection, and Incident Response" and we
are specifically looking forward to submissions that present
hardware-assisted approaches in this domain.

# Aim and Scope

Combining software and hardware aspects to consider new software attacks is
becoming increasingly important. For example, hardware vulnerabilities such
as Spectre or Meltdown can be exploited purely by software attacks.  Such
attacks can be executed remotely and do not require physical access to the
targeted hardware platform. On the other hand, hardware features can be
used to better detect and respond to traditional software attacks, such as
memory corruption. Therefore, it is necessary to study the security of
software/hardware interfaces in terms of attacks and defences.

The purpose of the HS3 workshop is to share experience, tools and
methodology on hardware-assisted software security. On one hand, we need to
propose new architectures offering better resilience against software
attacks. These architectures should rely on hardware-based security
mechanisms to protect the software stack. One of the challenges is to
formally specify and verify the security guarantees offered by such
architectures. On the other hand, we also need to assess better the
security guarantees provided by existing hardware architectures against
software attacks, especially attacks against micro-architecture. This can
be achieved by identifying new vulnerabilities using reverse engineering,
fuzzing or other attack approaches. The goal of the HS3 workshop is to
provide a forum for  researchers and practitioners from academia, industry
and government that work on hardware-assisted software security.

#### Special Theme: Secure Monitoring, Intrusion Detection, and Incident Response

Intrusion Detection System have become ubiquitous cybersecurity tools that
monitor network traffic or other system activity to then identify anomalous
behaviour or policy violations. Upon detection, these systems may alert
security teams or central security systems, reporting potential threats, or
even trigger automated responses. For this year's edition of the HS3
workshop, we especially encourage submissions that investigate questions
regarding the hardware-supported design of such systems. We are
specifically interested in submissions in the area of secure monitoring,
intrusion detection, and incident response, and we seek to develop a
special track, potentially with invited talks or panel discussions, on this
domain.

#### Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited, to the following

* Hardware-based security mechanisms
* Hardware-assisted and secure system monitoring
* Hardware-assisted intrusion detection and reaction
* Hardware-assisted privacy and anonymity
* Hardware enclaves and Trusted Execution Environments
* Security co-processors
* Leveraging hardware features at the software level (e.g. compiler, OS)
  for security
* Hardware/software contracts for security
* Formal methods applied to the hardware-assisted security
* Hardware trace mechanisms for security
* OS and VM introspection
* Software side-channel attacks
* Software attacks against micro-architecture
* Software-activated fault attacks

#### Location and Venue

HS3 2025 is co-located with the [30th European Symposium on Research in
Computer Security](https://esorics2025.sciencesconf.org/?lang=en) in
Toulouse, France. The workshop will take place right after the main
conference, on the 25th of September 2025.

A [plain-text version of this Call for Papers](hs3-2025-cfp.txt) is
available.


# Submission and Publication

There are two categories of submissions:

1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results (20
   pages, references included, LNCS format)
2. Short papers, position papers, industry experience reports, work-in-
   progress submissions and ideas (10 pages, references included, LNCS
format; work-in-progress and idea submissions should clearly outline the
research hypothesis, evaluation strategy and potential impact)

All papers must be written in English and describe original work that has
not been published or submitted elsewhere. The submission category (regular
paper, short paper, special theme) should be clearly indicated. Members of
the The Program Committee will fully review all submissions.  Papers will
be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series as workshop post-proceedings of ESORICS 2025. Contact the Program
Chairs if you *do not want your short paper* to appear in the proceedings.

Papers must be typeset in LaTeX using the [LNCS
template](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be
grounds for rejection. Well-marked appendices do not count into the page
limit; PC members are also not required to consider material presented in
appendices when reviewing submissions. We will clarify the constraints for
including appendices in camera-ready papers closer to the camera-ready
deadline and after discussion with the workshop chairs and the publisher.
We follow the ESORICS Call for Papers regarding anonymity of submissions and
do not require papers to be anonymised. Anonymised submissions are,
however, welcome at HS3.

Paper must be submitted through the ESORICS EasyChair website; select the
"HS3" track toindicate that you are submitting to this workshop: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esorics2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esorics2025)

For accepted papers, authors must agree with Springer LNCS copyright and at
least one author must attend the workshop.
